This program was created to monitor the time spent on a computer.  To some
extent it will also police usage.  When the allowed time each day comes to
an end, the user is warned that the computer will soon shut down, and then
when the time is exhausted, it is shut down.

For now this program is fairly easy to bypass, but it is intended to police
children, and as such it is not expected that they would yet know how to use
the task manager to terminate a program.  A future update will address this
issue.
